I'm working on a big redesign of my company's flagship product. I think my
team could deliver a big win for our business and our users with a mobile-first,
responsive web design, but my manager and other key stakeholders are worried
about the extra time and expense that such an approach might require. What
are your thoughts?

<!--ANSWER-->

First of all, there's only one man who "delivers wins" and that's
me, JOHNVOGT, when I play softball. Second, nobody gives a crap about your
users unless I happen to be one of them. And I'll tell you what I want. I want
*the full goll-dang website.* When you're the New York Yankees of People, you
don't have to worry about small screens because you've got New York Yankees of
Android phones, and it's got a big freakin' 9-inch OLED. And by "you've got,"
I mean "I've got." I don't know what kind of overpriced weakling Apple iPhone
you're using, but I'll bet it's total freakin' garbage.
