I find myself in the market for some affordable, reliable transportation. Could
you recommend a make and model of car for me to buy?

<!--ANSWER-->

This question is such total garbage that I don't even know where to start. Only
Communists and soccer fans drive "affordable, reliable transportation." All
red-blooded sports-loving Americans drive big honkin' pickup trucks,
1960s muscle cars, and Chevrolet Impalas.

As The New York Yankees of People, I hold myself to an even higher standard.
That's why I drive the most badass vehicle ever to be forged from American
steel.

That's right, weakling chumps, it's both a freakin' fighter jet and a goll-darn
tank *at the same time!* Someone has to save your scrawny weakling butts from
Al-Qaeda, World Cup Soccer, [Fabien Potencier][1], and other foreigners who hate
us for our freedom and our sportsball.

Yeah, my ride's pretty freakin' sweet, but two jet engines and 3 105 mm cannons
are too much freakin' car for women and teenagers to handle. When my kids start
driving, I'm gonna start them out with just a regular car:

Then I might let them drive my fighter jet tank when they can hit as many home
runs as me.

Just kidding, bro! It's not even possible to hit as many home runs as me.

Wait, did you have some sort of freakin' question or something? Whatever. Get
lost weakling&mdash;I'm gonna go to the gym.
